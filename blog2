Announcing Weblate


Following a week of (not so heavy) development, I can announce Weblate â€” a web-based translation tool with tight Git integration.

Unhappy with existing solutions, it came to be (see my blog post) because all of them were missing features I find useful. I started with a simple definition:

    Minimalistic web-based translation with direct commits to Git for each translation made. There is no plan of heavy conflict resolution, as this should primarily be handled on the Git side.

The project also started with a defined list of features:

    Easy web-based translation
    Propagation of translations across sub-projects (for different branches)
    Tight Git integration
    Use of Django's admin interface
    Uploading and automatic merging of PO files
    Links to source files for context

Pretty much all of that is completed, however there will definitely be some issues in need of fixing.

All important info about the project is available on the website. The code is hosted on GitHub. If you are curious how it looks, try it out on the demo server. Log in there with the account "demo" using "demo" as the password, or register your own user.

Please give it a test, as I plan to deploy it on http://l10n.cihar.com/ fairly soon.
