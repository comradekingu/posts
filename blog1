Looking for Pootle alternative

For some time, Pootle has served as a online translation tool for phpMyAdmin. Indeed a great tool, but somehow we are hitting more and more issues with. I feel it really won't fit nicely once we support translations on two divergent branches. Also its codebase is not easily understood to where I would be able to fix bugs myself without major effort.

This is when I started to look for alternatives. Unfortunately nothing I could find would work the way I want it to. Between looking at Transifex, Translatewiki, Crowdin and yet others, I still haven't found what I'm looking for.

The key feature I want from such a system is full integration with Git. This means whatever is changed should be committed to a local Git branch. Merging translations back should be as easy as merging a remote branch. I've hacked such thing into Pootle (in quite an ugly manner). That is the workflow we have right now and I'm pretty much happy with that.

Another thing (which seems a feature of other tools) is support for simultaneous translation of more branches — if the same string exists in more branches, it should be translated in all of them. Last but not least, it should support imported PO file from translations made offline.

Thinking about this, it should be pretty easy to implement something I want using existing pieces of software, without major effort. I'll probably start to play around with Django, Translate Tookit and GitPython to see if I can come up with something working reasonably well in few days…

PS: Anybody working on updated GitPython packages for Debian, looks like I will need them soon :-).

The solution for me is Weblate.
